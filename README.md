# Multilingual-Automatic-Speech-recognition_NUS-research
In this repository, we have developed an end to end Automatic speech recognition project. We have developed the neural network model for automatic speech recognition with PyTorch and used MLflow to manage the ML lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility, deployment, and a central model registry.
